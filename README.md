It’s important to know what Mother Nature is going to throw at you each day – what if you wear flip flops because it’s sunny and 65 degrees in the morning and then it snows all afternoon (this is Colorado, after all).

As web developers you’re going to be living in the context of the web. With this next project you will be interacting with a web-api. Ultimately this is going to be a preview for what the real world is going to look like for most of you. Data is important and thats what the API provides. As a web-developer you will be giving value to that data by visualizing and organizing that data for your user base.

In this project you will be getting your first real interactions with ReactJS, asynchronous javascript, and managing the state of your application.

Required Technology

ReactJS
jQuery for AJAX only (No DOM manipulation)
Sass
Phase one

Your application should have a welcome page that greets the user. The welcome page has an input field that asks the user for it’s current location / desired location

Once the desired location is submitted a weekly forecast overview (morning/evening for 7 days) is shown.

There should be a way for the user to change location information. Once the location information is changed the weather should reflect the desired location.

utilize sass variables and color scheme of app changes based on the weather and temp.

location persists after refresh.

Phase two

Display likely-hood of weather event happening

Each day should have a summary of what the weather will look like ex: Today: Sunny Today, It's currently 42, the high will be 46

Application should handle when a user searches for a location that is not found by the API. Team should research different ways to handle unfound locations by looking around on different weather and other location searching applications and implement a solution for their project that they find intuitive.

Phase three

Application should render an image that best reflects the weather.

Have an alert if an extreme weather event is forecasted in the area the user has specified (tornado watch, flood watch, blizzard watch, etc).

Extension

If a user clicks on a specific day on the 7 day forecast the application should display an hourly breakdown of the forecasted weather for a 24-hour period.
